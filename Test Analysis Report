Test Analysis Report
Report and summary 
Coming up with a platform to sell/buy services was thought to be easy initially. 
However, implementing the functions that the website provides proved to be quite a challenging task. 
During implementation, we encountered many errors.
We did not manage to fully complete Iteration 1, thus may result in delay of the progress of the Gantt chart.
Upload image and displaying them is still under testing and implementation.
Besides that, when we minimize the window. The layout of the website will change, causing images, headers to be misplaced.
Running the website on Internet explorer causes some layout problem compared to Google chrome.
Resolving this issue may be performed in Iteration 2. 

Overall, the tests were successful in identifying important flaws that we may have overlooked.
Besides the issue with displaying images, other requirements set for Iteration 1 have been met.
