Introduction
Nowadays, people tend to rely more and more on the internet. This is due to the fact that
internet has provided people with the convenience of discovering new things and reaching out to new people around the world.
Besides opening a shop to start their business or to sell their services, people are starting to see the internet 
as a more economical and convenient alternative to start their business.
However, creating such an online platform is not an easy task and requires professional skills.
