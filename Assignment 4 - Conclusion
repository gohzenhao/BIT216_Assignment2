After having completed iteration 1 and iteration 2 on time according to gantt chart,
we successfully met all of the objectives defined in assignment 1. 
This is because we managed to implement the main functionality of the use cases we set out to complete which are :
	1.  Login / signup 
	2. Create / customize service
	3. Add service to cart
	4. Search / sort / filter services
	5. View transaction history
	6. Give comment and rating
However, there are a few minor functionalities that have not been implemented for some of the use cases.
We did not implement edit function for service and preview image when creating a new service. 
The problem we encountered for the edit function is the new information would not be recorded to the database when we click the save.
The system cannot find the image file to preview before it was uploaded to database. It can only find the image file after it is uploaded.
