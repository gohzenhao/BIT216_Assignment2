We successfully completed unit testing, integrated testing and system testing. 
The test plan we set out initially was achieved without any issues. 
The remaining use cases for iteration 2 were implemented and tested without any problems. 
All the test data we defined covers up all the possibilities that a user can enter or select. 
All activities were completed according to Gantt chart.
The delete function for review was not implemented. Therefore, we did not manage to undergo testing for that particular function.
