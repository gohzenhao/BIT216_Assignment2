Problems Faced in Iteration 1

  Implementing some of the functions such as uploading post an image was quite difficult as the post is uploaded in the database
and the front-end post page needs to be updated. After some research, we were able to get the page to have a post with a hyperlink
inside that links to the post detail page to show up by using some php codes.

  Although upload image was successful as the image was saved into the database, we had some difficulties with previewing the
image when the image is uploaded. However, it is possible for this problem to be fixed as we require more research to implement
some codes to show the image when uploaded.
