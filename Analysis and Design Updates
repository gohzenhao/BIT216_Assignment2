	After some research and discussion of the implementation of the use cases, 
  we decided that functionalities such as adding comments and ratings should be done after solving the minor problems we had in iteration 1
  as they are more simplified.
  
  Viewing transaction history should be completed first compared to the other use cases because it is straight forward. 
  
  The search bar can be done last as we would have extra time after completing the less challenging ones as this functionality can be 
  quite a challenge because of the complex algorithms we have to design.
  
	As for the Design updates, we had to adjust some of the front-end format to make everything look consistent where the post displayed
  will appear as a tile so that users can identify the post easily and it would seem to be more user friendly. 
  
 We also changed the layout of some pages to utilize the empty spaces more effectively. 
 
We revised the “Service” table in the database. “Average rating” was added into the table to display it on the website along 
with other details. “Buyer ID” and “Seller ID” was also added into the “TransactionHistory” table to easily identify the buyer and seller.
