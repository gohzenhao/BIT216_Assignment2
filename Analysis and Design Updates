Analysis and Design Updates

  After some research and discussion of the implementation of the use cases, we decided that functionalities
such as adding comments and ratings should be done after solving the image preview problem as they are very
simple to do then the view transaction history because it is not very difficult to implement as it just
fetches data from the database. However, the search bar can be done last as we would have extra time after
completing the less challenging ones as this functionality can prove to be quite a challenge because it is
difficult to make it function the way we intend such as finding the post related to the key word which most
likely require using SQL database queries.
