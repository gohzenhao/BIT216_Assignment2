Analysis and Design Updates

  After some research and discussion of the implementation of the use cases, we decided that functionalities
such as adding comments and ratings should be done after solving the image preview problem as they are very
simple to do then the view transaction history because it is not very difficult to implement as it just
fetches data from the database. However, the search bar can be done last as we would have extra time after
completing the less challenging ones as this functionality can prove to be quite a challenge because it is
difficult to make it function the way we intend such as finding the post related to the key word which most
likely require using SQL database queries.

    As for the Design updates, we had to adjust some of the front-end format to make everything look consistent
  where the post displayed will appear as a tile so that users can identify the post easily and it would seem
  to be more user friendly. Moreover, we added the ratings and comments function to the posts while we also had
  to update the database by adding a new table called reviews. It was decided that with these functions, it can
  improve the usersâ€™ experience when using the site as they can tell if the post is legit or not.
  
  The sample Review table:
Name of Data	Type of Data	Size of Data
serviceID	    varchar	          20
userID	      varchar	          20
date	        date	            10
rating	      decimal	          5
comment	      varchar	          50
